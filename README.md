## How to add pics

- Drag and drop the new pictures you'd like to add in the `public/images` folder

- Run the following script `node tools && yarn prettier:fix` from the root of the project

- Verify that the new pic is shown in the app by running `yarn start`

- Create a new branch and deploy the new version of the app
